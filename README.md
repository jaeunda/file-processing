# File Processing
This repository contains three separate projects focused on different file processing techniques, including low-level flash memory operations, hybrid Flash Translation Layer (FTL) mapping, and record-based file I/O.


## Projects


### 1. Flash I/O: Flash Device Driver
A simple emulator for flash memory operations.
Supports block-level write, read, erase, and in-place update.


### 2. Hybrid Mapping FTL
Implements a Flash Translation Layer (FTL) using a hybrid mapping scheme.
Handles logical-to-physical address translation and manages block allocation and garbage collection.


### 3. Record I/O
Handles structured record storage with field-based access.
Supports append, search, delete, and insert operations on fixed-format student records.
